# MarchioniLab

We are the @MarchioniLab at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/).

We have an extensive presence on the Cancer Genomics, Biomedical Data Science, and Integrative Systems Biology fields.

Our mission is to apply quantitative approaches to interpret high-dimensional genomic data, understand cancer cell biology, and develop useful clinical tools to improve cancer patients' outcomes.

We are leading the efforts in the Computational Systems Pathology Division at Weill Cornell Medicine to bring state of the art approaches closer to patients care.
